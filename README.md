# moonlight-client
## A casual 1.8 Minecraft client with optifine.
---
The client was developed with MCP 910 and OptiFine 1.8 HD U H6, using Eclipse 2023-09 (4.29.0).
---
**The uploaded files are only the custom packages for the client.**
---
I've done crucial changes to some critical main game files (like *Minecraft.java*), so you need to [DOWNLOAD](https://vb2007.hu/cdn/moonlight-client.zip) the modified 1.8 MCP (mod coder pack) to debug the client.
Obviously I can't just upload the whole pack to GitHub, since it's almost a gigabyte.
---
When the download is completed, just open **Eclipse**, and enter the ***..\moonlight-client\eclipse*** path.
Then you're ready to run & debug.
